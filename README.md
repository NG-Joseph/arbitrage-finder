# What is Arbitrage Betting?
Arbitrage betting – also known as arbs betting, surebets, miraclebets and surewins – is a technique in which you place bets with different online betting companies to cover all the outcomes of a sporting event to guarantee yourself profit.

So if there are two outcomes such as Both teams to score (GG) and both teams not to score (NG). Across 2 betting platforms, differences in odds can guarantee you profit regardless of what finally happens.

For example, 1xBet could price a Floyd Mayweather Jr win at decimal odds of 1.48 (67.6% implied probability) whereas 888Sport could think he’s even more likely to win and offer odds of 1.36 (73.5% implied probability).

As a result, the price on his opponent would also change between the two bookies and mean that backing the underdog could see a range between 2.75 (36.4% probability) and 3.25 (30.8% probability). If the numbers add up correctly, you could find that backing Mayweather with 1xBet and his opponent with 888Sport could automatically put you into the green no matter who won the bout.

As shown in this boxing example, generally there is only a slight difference between the prices set by bookmakers. This means that you need to bet a lot of money to make arbing worthwhile, as arbitrage bets typically range between 1% and 10% profit.

This could mean that a £1,000 stake would return as little as £10 and as much as £100, which may not be worth the vast amounts of time taken to identify the surebet in the first place.

**The profit margin for an arb bet isn't that high. It falls between 1-10%. But imagine if you rolled that money over for a new bet daily for 20 days a month**

## What's in it for you?
From my calculations, if you start with 5k, within a year if you don't take any money out you'd have 19 million naira (assuming your arb bets had an average of 3.5% profit)


Arbitrate betting has to be one of the best-kept secrets in the betting world because it's what the 'serious' bettors do  to guarantee profits.However, the rarity in finding these games is what has discouraged so many people. So they end up paying to use arbitrage software which costs about 100 euros a month!

## AIM 
The primary aim of this project is to create a python program that scrapes data from multiple betting sites and automatically finds arb games between them. In future we can automate the betting process and connect it to our betting accounts to take advantage of these opportunities as fast as possible. But for now we'll stick with manual.
