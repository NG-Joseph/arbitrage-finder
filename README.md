# What is Arbitrage Betting?
Arbitrage betting – also known as arbs betting, surebets, miraclebets and surewins – is a technique in which you place bets with different online betting companies to cover all the outcomes of a sporting event to guarantee yourself profit.

So if there are two outcomes such as Both teams to score (GG) and both teams not to score (NG). Across 2 betting platforms, differences in odds can guarantee you profit regardless of what finally happens.

For example, 1xBet could price a Floyd Mayweather Jr win at decimal odds of 1.48 (67.6% implied probability) whereas 888Sport could think he’s even more likely to win and offer odds of 1.36 (73.5% implied probability).

As a result, the price on his opponent would also change between the two bookies and mean that backing the underdog could see a range between 2.75 (36.4% probability) and 3.25 (30.8% probability). If the numbers add up correctly, you could find that backing Mayweather with 1xBet and his opponent with 888Sport could automatically put you into the green no matter who won the bout.

As shown in this boxing example, generally there is only a slight difference between the prices set by bookmakers. This means that you need to bet a lot of money to make arbing worthwhile, as arbitrage bets typically range between 1% and 10% profit.

This could mean that a £1,000 stake would return as little as £10 and as much as £100, which may not be worth the vast amounts of time taken to identify the surebet in the first place.
